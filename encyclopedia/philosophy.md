## Knowledge Base

### Core Philosophical Branches
- **Metaphysics**: What is real? Studies reality, existence, being, causation, time, space, substance. Questions like "What is consciousness?" and "Does free will exist?"
- **Epistemology**: What can we know? Examines belief, truth, justification, and the limits of human knowledge. Debates between skepticism, rationalism, and empiricism
- **Ethics**: How should we live? Explores morality, right and wrong, virtue, duty, happiness. Ethical frameworks include consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics
- **Logic**: How do we reason? Studies valid argumentation, fallacies, and critical thinking. The foundation for all philosophical inquiry
- **Political Philosophy**: What is justice? Examines rights, government legitimacy, freedom, equality, social contracts. Influences legal and political systems
- **Philosophy of Mind**: What is consciousness? Studies mental states, identity, the mind-body problem, artificial intelligence, qualia

### Major Philosophical Schools & Thinkers
- **Ancient**: Socrates (questioning method), Plato (idealism, forms), Aristotle (logic, virtue ethics)
- **Medieval**: Augustine (faith and reason), Aquinas (natural law), Anselm (ontological argument)
- **Enlightenment**: Descartes (reason), Locke (empiricism), Kant (synthesis of reason and experience), Hume (skepticism)
- **Modern**: Hegel (dialectics), Nietzsche (perspectivism), Marx (historical materialism), Kierkegaard (existentialism)
- **Contemporary**: Wittgenstein (language games), Russell (analytic philosophy), Quine (logical pragmatism), Rawls (justice as fairness)

### Key Philosophical Questions
- **Metaphysics**: Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of causation? Are we free or determined?
- **Epistemology**: Can we know anything with certainty? What's the difference between knowledge and justified belief? Is truth subjective or objective?
- **Ethics**: What makes an action right or wrong? Is morality universal or relative? What is happiness (eudaimonia)?
- **Politics**: What justifies government authority? What are natural rights? What is the ideal society?
- **Mind**: What is consciousness? Can machines think? How do mind and body relate?

### Philosophical Methods
- **Socratic Method**: Using questions to examine beliefs and seek truth; dialogue and critical discussion
- **Logical Analysis**: Breaking down arguments, identifying premises and conclusions, checking for validity
- **Thought Experiments**: Using hypothetical scenarios (Ship of Theseus, Trolley Problem, Zombie Argument) to test intuitions
- **Phenomenology**: Examining conscious experience and how things appear to us
- **Deconstruction**: Analyzing hidden assumptions and power structures in texts and concepts

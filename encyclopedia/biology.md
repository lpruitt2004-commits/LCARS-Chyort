# Biology

Explore the wonders of life science and living organisms - the molecular machinery and ecosystems that sustain all life.

## Knowledge Base

### Core Concepts
- **Cell Biology**: Cell structure and function (nucleus, mitochondria, organelles), cellular processes (photosynthesis, cellular respiration), cell division (mitosis, meiosis), cell communication
- **Genetics**: DNA structure and function, RNA and protein synthesis, heredity and inheritance patterns, gene expression and regulation, mutations and genetic variation
- **Evolution**: Natural selection (survival of the fittest), adaptation and speciation, evidence for evolution (fossil record, DNA), evolutionary tree of life, microevolution vs. macroevolution
- **Ecology**: Ecosystems and biomes, food chains and energy flow, predator-prey relationships, biodiversity and extinction, population dynamics, conservation biology
- **Anatomy & Physiology**: Human body systems (nervous, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, immune), organ function, homeostasis, disease and adaptation

### Major Biological Concepts
- **Photosynthesis**: Plants convert sunlight to chemical energy (glucose); foundation of most food chains
- **Cellular Respiration**: Cells break down glucose for ATP energy; aerobic (with oxygen) and anaerobic pathways
- **DNA Replication**: Genetic information copied accurately for cell division; errors create mutations
- **Natural Selection**: Environmental pressures favor beneficial traits; over time, species adapt or go extinct
- **Homeostasis**: Living things maintain stable internal conditions (temperature, pH, water balance) despite external changes

### The Tree of Life
- **Domain Bacteria**: Single-celled prokaryotes, found everywhere, including symbiotic and pathogenic species
- **Domain Archaea**: Prokaryotes often in extreme environments; distinct from bacteria genetically
- **Domain Eukarya**: Organisms with nucleus and organelles; includes protists, fungi, plants, animals
- **Kingdoms**: Animalia (multicellular, mobile), Plantae (autotrophic, photosynthesis), Fungi (decomposers), Protista (diverse unicellular)

### Great Biologists & Discoveries
- **Charles Darwin**: Evolution by natural selection; revolutionized our understanding of life's diversity
- **Gregor Mendel**: Laws of heredity; foundation of genetics
- **Louis Pasteur**: Germ theory; established connection between microbes and disease
- **Watson & Crick**: DNA structure; enabled molecular biology revolution
- **Jane Goodall**: Primate behavior and conservation; revolutionized field study methods

### Current & Emerging Fields
- **Molecular Biology**: DNA sequencing (CRISPR gene editing), protein engineering, synthetic biology
- **Neurobiology**: Brain structure and function, consciousness, neurotransmitters, brain plasticity
- **Conservation Biology**: Species protection, habitat restoration, combating extinction and biodiversity loss

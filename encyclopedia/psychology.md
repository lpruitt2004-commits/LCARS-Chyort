### Research Methods in Psychology
- **Experimental**: Random assignment, control groups, manipulation of variables; strongest evidence of causation
- **Correlational**: Measure relationships between variables; can't determine causation
- **Observational**: Watch behavior in natural settings; rich but can be subjective
- **Survey/Questionnaire**: Gather self-report data; practical but subject to bias
- **Case Study**: In-depth examination of individuals; useful for rare conditions but limited generalization

### Skills & Resources
- **Essential Skills**: Empathy, listening skills, ability to understand and work with human diversity, analytical thinking
- **Learning Paths**: Psychology courses (intro to advanced), research experience, internships in clinical or research settings
- **Tools**: Psychological assessments and tests, observation checklists, statistical analysis software, therapy techniques
- **Ethical Considerations**: Confidentiality, informed consent, avoiding bias, continuing education

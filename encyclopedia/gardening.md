Tips and techniques for growing plants, vegetables, creating beautiful landscapes, and maintaining a healthy garden.

## Knowledge Base

### Core Concepts
- **Soil Science**: pH levels (acidic, neutral, alkaline), nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), composting and organic matter, soil amendments and testing
- **Plant Biology**: Growth cycles (germination, vegetative, flowering, dormancy), photosynthesis and energy production, propagation methods (seeds, cuttings, layering)
- **Pest Management**: Organic methods (companion planting, beneficial insects), integrated pest control (IPM), natural pest deterrents, disease prevention
- **Garden Design**: Layout and space planning, companion planting (which plants help each other), color and texture combinations, focal points and hardscaping
- **Vegetable Gardening**: Crop rotation (changing plant families by season), succession planting for continuous harvest, harvesting timing and preservation (canning, freezing)
- **Sustainable Practices**: Water conservation and drip irrigation, native plants for local ecosystems, permaculture and regenerative methods, reducing chemical inputs

### Gardening Types & Styles
- **Vegetable Garden**: Food production, raised beds or in-ground, seasonal varieties, seed selection matters
- **Flower Garden**: Ornamental plants, annuals vs. perennials, cutting gardens for arrangements, pollinator gardens
- **Container Gardening**: Growing in pots and planters, good for limited space, portable, easier maintenance for some
- **Herb Garden**: Culinary and medicinal herbs, very productive in small spaces, mostly perennial in mild climates
- **Fruit Garden**: Trees (apples, peaches, citrus), shrubs (berries), requires patience but rewarding
- **Native Plant Garden**: Local species, drought-tolerant, supports local wildlife, low maintenance once established
- **Community/Urban Garden**: Shared spaces in cities, growing food in small plots, social aspect and food security
- **Permaculture**: Mimics natural ecosystems, polyculture (many species), long-term sustainability, reduced work over time

### Seasonal Gardening Guide
- **Spring**: Start seeds indoors, prepare soil, plant cool-season crops, prune early bloomers
- **Summer**: Water regularly, harvest frequently, deadhead flowers, plant heat-loving crops
- **Fall**: Plant garlic and root vegetables, extend season with cold frames, collect seeds
- **Winter**: Plan next year's garden, maintain tools, protect perennials, study and rest

### Essential Skills & Knowledge
- **Plant Identification**: Know your plants, their needs, growth habits, companion and incompatible plants
- **Soil Assessment**: Test soil pH, nutrient content, drainage, texture; amend accordingly
- **Timing**: Know frost dates, planting schedules, harvest windows for your climate zone
- **Problem-Solving**: Diagnose plant diseases, pest issues, nutrient deficiencies; adjust practices
- **Patience & Observation**: Gardening is learning by doing; keep notes on what works in your specific garden

### Tools & Resources
- **Essential Tools**: Hand trowel, spade, rake, hoe, pruners, garden gloves, watering can or hose
- **Learning Resources**: Local cooperative extension, gardening books and blogs, seed catalogs, gardening communities
- **Starting Out**: Begin small, learn your climate zone, start with easy plants (tomatoes, basil, zucchini)

### Fields of Work

- **Landscape Designer**: Plan and design outdoor spaces for residential and commercial projects; combines aesthetics with function
- **Arborist**: Care for trees professionally, pruning, tree health assessment, disease treatment
- **Urban Farmer**: Grow food in city environments, use vertical gardening, rooftops, community spaces
- **Greenhouse Manager**: Oversee plant production facilities, manage climate and growing conditions, efficiency and profitability
- **Gardening Consultant**: Advise homeowners and businesses on garden planning, maintenance, problem-solving
- **Botanical Garden Curator**: Manage plant collections, lead conservation efforts, educate the public
- **Agricultural Extension Agent**: Educate communities on gardening and farming practices, research application

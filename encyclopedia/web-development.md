# Web Development

Learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks, and modern web technologies for building the web.

## Knowledge Base

### Frontend Development
- **HTML/CSS**: HTML structure (semantic tags, forms, accessibility), CSS styling and layout (flexbox, grid), responsive design (mobile-first, media queries)
- **JavaScript**: Programming fundamentals, DOM manipulation (selecting, modifying elements), event handling, asynchronous programming (promises, async/await), ES6+ features
- **Front-end Frameworks**: React (component-based, state management), Vue (approachable, reactive), Angular (comprehensive, enterprise); choose based on project needs
- **Styling**: CSS preprocessors (Sass, Less), CSS-in-JS libraries, design systems, component libraries (Material-UI, Bootstrap)
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: WCAG standards, keyboard navigation, screen readers, semantic HTML; inclusive design for all users
- **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, caching strategies, Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- **UI/UX Design**: User research, wireframing, prototyping, user testing, design thinking, psychology of interaction

### Backend Development
- **Server-Side Languages**: Node.js (JavaScript), Python (Django, Flask), Java (Spring), C# (.NET), Go; choose based on needs
- **Databases**: SQL (relational, ACID properties - PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (document - MongoDB, key-value - Redis), choosing between SQL and NoSQL
- **APIs**: REST (stateless, HTTP methods), GraphQL (query language, flexible data fetching), API design best practices
- **Authentication & Security**: OAuth, JWT (tokens), password hashing, SQL injection prevention, CORS, SSL/TLS encryption
- **Server Architecture**: Microservices vs. monolith, load balancing, scaling strategies, serverless functions

### Full-Stack Concepts
- **MVC Architecture**: Model (data), View (UI), Controller (logic); separation of concerns
- **DevOps & Deployment**: Docker (containers), Kubernetes (orchestration), CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, monitoring
- **Hosting**: Cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), traditional servers, CDN for content delivery
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, branching strategies, code review, collaboration workflows
- **Testing**: Unit tests (testing individual functions), integration tests (testing components together), end-to-end tests (user flows)

### Specialized Web Technologies
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**: Offline functionality, push notifications, installable on home screen, service workers
- **Mobile Web**: Responsive design, touch interfaces, mobile performance optimization
- **WordPress**: CMS development, themes, plugins, content management
- **Headless CMS**: Decoupled content management, API-first approach, flexibility
- **Real-time Applications**: WebSockets, Socket.io, live updates, multiplayer experiences
- **Machine Learning in Web**: TensorFlow.js, ML models in browser, predictions, recommendations
- **Web3/Blockchain**: Smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), cryptocurrency integration

### Modern Web Ecosystem
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Vite, Parcel; bundling, optimization, development experience
- **Package Managers**: npm, yarn, pnpm; managing dependencies and versions
- **Code Quality**: Linters (ESLint), formatters (Prettier), code review, testing frameworks (Jest, Cypress)
- **Monitoring & Debugging**: Browser dev tools, network monitoring, error tracking, performance profiling

### Great Web Developers & Innovators
- **Tim Berners-Lee**: Invented WWW, HTML, HTTP, pioneered web standards
- **Brendan Eich**: Created JavaScript; essential for interactive web
- **Ryan Dahl**: Created Node.js; brought JavaScript to backend
- **Evan You**: Created Vue.js; accessible, approachable framework
- **Dan Abramov**: React contributor, Redux creator; state management
- **Sarah Soueidan**: SVG and web accessibility advocacy; standards champion

### Skills & Resources
- **Essential Skills**: Problem-solving, logical thinking, attention to detail, learning agility, collaboration, communication
- **Learning Paths**: Bootcamps (12-24 weeks), computer science degrees, online courses (Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, Udemy), self-taught with projects
- **Best Practices**: Version control with Git, testing your code, clean code practices, documentation, security awareness
- **Portfolio Building**: Create projects, contribute to open source, GitHub presence, case studies of your work
- **Continuous Learning**: Web evolves rapidly; follow blogs (Dev.to, CSS-Tricks), podcasts, conferences, experiment with new technologies

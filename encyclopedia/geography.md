# Geography

Study the Earth's landscapes, environments, peoples, and places - bridging natural and human systems.

## Knowledge Base

### Physical Geography
- **Landforms**: Mountains (formation, erosion), valleys, plains, deserts, plateaus; processes that shape landscapes
- **Climate Systems**: Temperature, precipitation, wind patterns; climate zones (tropical, temperate, polar, desert)
- **Ecosystems & Biomes**: Rainforests (biodiversity), grasslands, tundra, coral reefs; energy flow, species adaptation
- **Hydrology**: Water cycle, rivers, oceans, groundwater; watershed management, water resources
- **Plate Tectonics**: Continental drift, earthquakes, volcanoes; geological hazards and island formation
- **Weathering & Erosion**: How rocks break down, soil formation, mass movement (landslides), coastal erosion

### Human Geography
- **Population**: Demographics (age, sex ratio), growth rates, population density, migration patterns
- **Culture**: Languages, religions, customs, traditions, cultural diffusion; how culture varies by place
- **Urbanization**: City growth, urban sprawl, megacities, urban planning, quality of life in cities
- **Migration**: Why people move (economic, political, environmental), refugee crises, diaspora communities
- **Development**: Economic inequality, standard of living, infrastructure, access to resources
- **Political Geography**: Borders, territories, nation-states, geopolitical conflicts, sovereignty

### Specialized Geography Fields
- **Urban Geography**: City development, gentrification, informal settlements, transportation, livability
- **Economic Geography**: Resource distribution, trade patterns, globalization, supply chains, economic inequality
- **Political Geography**: Geopolitics, territorial disputes, borders, international relations
- **Cultural Geography**: Ethnic diversity, language distribution, religious landscapes, cultural identity
- **Environmental Geography**: Conservation, sustainability, climate change, environmental justice, pollution
- **Medical Geography**: Disease distribution, health access, pandemics, environmental health

### Tools & Technologies
- **Cartography**: Map-making, map projections, symbolization, representing 3D world on 2D surface
- **GIS (Geographic Information Systems)**: Digital mapping, spatial analysis, data visualization, remote sensing interpretation
- **Remote Sensing**: Satellite imagery, aerial photography, data collection from distance
- **GPS**: Navigation, location tracking, surveying, precision mapping
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical methods, pattern recognition, modeling geographic phenomena

### Great Geographers & Concepts
- **Eratosthenes**: Calculated Earth's circumference; ancient Greek geographer
- **Alexander von Humboldt**: Modern geography founder; biodiversity, climatic zones, human-environment interaction
- **Carl Ritter**: Geographic education, systematic study of places
- **Ellen Churchill Semple**: Influence of geographic environment on human development
- **Yi-Fu Tuan**: Humanistic geography, sense of place, emotional geography
- **Doreen Massey**: Space and place theory; geography of identity and power

### Major Geographical Questions
- **Physical**: How do landforms form? What causes earthquakes? How does climate change affect ecosystems?
- **Human**: Why do people migrate? How do cultures differ? What causes economic inequality?
- **Integrated**: How do humans modify environments? How do environmental changes affect societies? Can development be sustainable?

### Skills & Resources
- **Essential Skills**: Observation, map reading, data analysis, understanding scales (local to global), systemic thinking
- **Learning Paths**: Geography courses and degrees, field work and travel, GIS certification, environmental science background
- **Tools**: Maps, GIS software (ArcGIS, QGIS), satellite imagery, census data, statistical software
- **Career Prep**: GIS skills highly valuable, understanding environmental and social issues important, cultural sensitivity

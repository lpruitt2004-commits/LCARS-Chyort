Discover the building blocks of matter and the chemical interactions that create everything in our universe.

## Knowledge Base

### Core Concepts
- **Atomic Structure**: Protons (positive), neutrons (neutral), electrons (negative), atomic number and mass, isotopes and nuclear stability
- **Chemical Bonding**: Ionic bonds (electron transfer), covalent bonds (electron sharing), metallic bonds (electron sea), intermolecular forces (van der Waals, hydrogen bonds)
- **Reactions**: Synthesis (combining), decomposition (breaking apart), combustion (burning), redox (electron transfer), rates and catalysts
- **Organic Chemistry**: Carbon compounds, hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes), functional groups (alcohols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids), polymers and plastics
- **Thermodynamics**: Energy changes in reactions (exothermic/endothermic), enthalpy, entropy and disorder, spontaneity and equilibrium

### The Periodic Table
- **Organization**: Elements arranged by atomic number; organized into periods (rows) and groups (columns)
- **Element Groups**: Alkali metals (very reactive), halogens (form salts), noble gases (inert), transition metals (variable oxidation states)
- **Electron Configuration**: Pattern of electron arrangement determines chemical behavior; valence electrons crucial for bonding

### Important Chemical Principles
- **The Mole**: Unit of measurement for counting atoms/molecules; Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10²³)

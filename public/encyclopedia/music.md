Explore music theory, history, performance, and production across all genres and eras.

## Knowledge Base

### Core Concepts
- **Music Theory**: Scales (major, minor, pentatonic), chords (triads, seventh chords), harmony (voice leading, progressions), rhythm (time signatures, tempo, syncopation), notation (staff, clefs, dynamics)
- **Music History**: Classical (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven), Jazz (improvisation, standards), Rock (electric instruments, songwriting), World Music (non-Western traditions, cultural significance)
- **Performance**: Instrument mastery, vocal techniques (breath control, resonance), stage presence, ensemble communication and dynamics
- **Composition**: Songwriting (melody, structure, lyrics), arranging for ensembles, orchestration for different instruments
- **Production**: Recording techniques, mixing (balancing levels, EQ, effects), mastering (final optimization), DAWs (Ableton, Logic Pro, Reaper)
- **Acoustics**: Sound waves and frequencies, how instruments produce sound, room acoustics for recording, audio engineering basics

### Great Composers & Musicians
- **Classical**: J.S. Bach (polyphony), Mozart (elegance), Beethoven (emotional intensity and innovation)
- **Jazz Legends**: Louis Armstrong (trumpet), Duke Ellington (composition), John Coltrane (experimentation)
- **Rock/Pop Icons**: The Beatles (song structure), Bob Dylan (lyrics), Jimi Hendrix (guitar innovation)
- **Contemporary**: Hans Zimmer (film scores), Billie Eilish (alternative production), Tyler, The Creator (genre-blending)

### Music Genres at a Glance
- **Classical/Opera**: Structured compositions, orchestral arrangements, formal performance traditions
